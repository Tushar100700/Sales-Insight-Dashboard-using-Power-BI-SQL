# Sales Insight Dashboard using Power BI  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is inspired by the **CodeBasics YouTube channel** where I built an interactive **Sales Insight Dashboard** in Power BI to analyze and visualize business performance for a computer hardware company.  

[▶ CodeBasics YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhZ62IlTxYs&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9)  

## 🏢 Problem Statement  
AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals across India.  
The **Sales Director** is struggling to understand:  
- How the business is currently performing  
- Why sales are declining  
- Where the company is facing challenges  

Collecting updates from regional managers is inefficient, and consuming numbers from Excel reports makes it difficult to take quick, data-driven decisions.  

---

## 💡 Solution  
To address this, the **Sales Director** decided to implement a **Power BI Dashboard** that transforms raw sales data into clear and interactive visual insights. This enables faster, fact-based decision-making and better visibility of overall performance.  

### ✅ AIMS Grid  
We used the **AIMS grid project management tool** to define:  
- Purpose  
- Stakeholders  
- End result  
- Success criteria

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow  

1. Defined project goals using AIMS Grid.  
2. Connected **MySQL database** with Power BI for data retrieval.  
3. Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query**.  
4. Applied the **ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load)**.  
5. Created DAX measures for KPIs and analysis.  
6. Standardized multiple currencies through **currency conversion**.  
7. Validated and modeled the dataset.  
8. Designed **interactive dashboards** with clear insights.  

---

## 🔧 Customizations Made  

1. Resolved the “(blank)” issue in Products by creating a **custom product table** (Prod280 to Prod339 with assigned product types).  
2. Enhanced the `sales_transaction` table by merging it with a modified version that included **profit margin, cost price, etc.**  

---

## 📈 Insights from the Dashboard  

1. Over 4 years, the company generated **₹985M revenue**, **₹24.7M profit margin**, and **2.5% margin**.  
   - In 2020 alone: **₹142M revenue**, **350K units sold**, and **₹2.1M profit**.  
2. **Delhi NCR** contributed the highest revenue (₹520M, ~53%), but profit margin remained low at **2.3%**.  
3. **Bhubaneshwar** had the highest profit margin in 2020 at **10.48%**.  
4. **Bengaluru** showed the lowest profitability with **-20.8% margin**.  
5. Top customer: **Electricalsara Stores**, contributing **₹413M revenue**.  
6. Top product: **Prod318**, contributing **₹69M revenue**.  
7. Distribution & Own Brand products both generated ~**₹494M revenue** each.  
8. Revenue dropped sharply in **June 2020**, with April 2020 marking the **lowest profit margin**.
